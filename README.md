Program to find Fibonacci series using ava loops. Gets the number of elements of the Fibonacci series from the user.

What is Fibonacci Series?
The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers formed by adding each number to the previous one. In this series that continues in this way, when the numbers are proportional to each other, the golden ratio emerges, that is, when a number is divided by the number before it, a series that gets closer and closer to the golden ratio is obtained.

The Fibonacci sequence starts from 0 and goes to infinity. Each digit is added to the previous digit. The result obtained is written on the right side of the number. The first ten numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are as follows:

  9 Element Fibonacci Series: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
